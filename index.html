        <h2>My Story So Far</h2>

        <p>My name's Samatar, 27, and I'm aiming to become a Front-End Developer in the next 12 months.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in London, and my parents are from Somalia. I joined P2T, because I want to gain skills that will allow me to move to a muslim country in the future.</p>

        <p>I originally signed up to P2T in July 2024, but due to a combination of personal circumstances, and a lot of procrastinating, I put things to the side for a while. However, I decided to stop making excuses and start again. Better late than never as they say.</p>

        <p>As someone who doesn't have a university degree, I'm inspired by people that didn't let that derail them and built a future for themselves, and I want to do the same by breaking into tech.</p>
